ldapsh has two types of commands, just like a normal Unix shell: Built-in commands
and external commands.

Built-in commands can be listed by running 'builtins' at the ldapsh command
line.

External commands are slightly harder to list, just like in a normal Unix shell.
There is currently no way to list them from inside the shell, but it's
relatively easy to get a full list from a normal Unix shell.  By default 
they are all located at Net::LDAP::Shell::Commands, so you can list, 
for instance, /usr/local/lib/perl/site_perl/5.6.1/Net/LDAP/Shell/Commands, to
get a list of current commands.

You can set up ldapsh to search other directories, just like a normal Unix shell.
At this time you can only change it during runtime, but if you want the ability
to store that information, please send me a patch or email me the feature
request.

All commands accept a --help flag to get a usage statement.

The current list of available builtin commands is:

builtins
cd
config
debugging
exit
export
pwd
quit
reload

The current list of available external commands is:

cat
clone
edit
ls
new
rm
search
