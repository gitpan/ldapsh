WHAT

This is an LDAP shell.  I wrote it a long time ago, actually, but have
only recently gotten around to making it release-worthy.

It is composed of two parts:  Net::LDAP::Config, and ldapsh.

Net::LDAP::Config is a library for simplifying and centralizing
access to your LDAP repositories.  Instead of having every single
script ask for your ldap server and search base, or have it hard
coded, you can simply use this library:

my $config = Net::LDAP::Config->new("default");

It's got a couple other nice features, like the fact that it caches
your LDAP UID (per host), so you should only ever have to type it in
once.  It's pretty well documented, so 'perldoc Net::LDAP::config'
should get you the rest of the way.

ldapsh, and its corresponding library Net::LDAP::Shell, provide
(shockingly) the shell behaviour.  When run, ldapsh drops you into a
(very simple) interpreter.  Even given its simplicity, though, ldapsh
is still very useful:  You can use it to walk your LDAP tree, you can
clone existing objects (using the 'clone' command), remove objects
(can you guess the command?), and create new objects using 'new'.  The
'new' command, when provided one or more objectclasses, will
automatically retrieve the required and optional attributes for those
objectclasses, which can be a great time-saver.
