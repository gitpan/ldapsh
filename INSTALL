SETUP

1) Run the standard 'perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install'.

2) Copy examples/ldapsh_config to /usr/local/etc, /etc, or ~/.ldapsh_config,
and modify it to point to your ldap sources.

3) Run 'ldapsh'.  It will create a '.ldapuids' file
in your home directory as a cache of UIDs.

HELP

See 'perldoc ldapsh' for more detailed documentation.

COMMANDS

See the COMMANDS file, or run 'commands' in the shell.
